# Odin rock paper scissors

This is a simple implementation of grade-school classic "rock paper scissors". This program will take user's input as selection and compare it with a random computer generated choice. Whoever win gets 1 point and winner will be announced after 5 games. The game will be played completely from the console.

GUI will be updated in the future.
